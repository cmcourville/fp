### Team: Georgina Cromwell, Corrin Courville, Kaitlin McDermott
Website: https://final-project-gcc-cmc-kmd.glitch.me/

## Project Purpose:
The impact that you have on the environment is greater than you think. The purpose of our web application is for a user to understand just how great their impace is on the environment. It will raise awareness to all the little things in your daily routine that can be changed. 

## How to Use: 
- Create a username and password by pressing the sign-up button 
- login with the username and password you created
- on the home page, there are two data displays that are blank. 
- to add data, go to *submit a weekly report* and fill out the form 
- upon subit, you will be brought to the home page where teh data will display
- as you add data using the *weekly report*, the data displays will populate. 

## Technical Achievements: 

- user login using passport 
- css using bootstrap  
- css built from scratch
- data visualization using plotly (which is built off of d3/svg)
- persistant data using mongodb 
- server using express
- user inputs information using a form 
- After login, there are two views: 
  - data input (weekly form)
  - user's data visualization 

## Design Achievements: 
- user friendly UI 
- easy navigation between different views
- asthetically clean and pleasing visualiztion 
- font and colors that make the text easy to read
- impactful and thought provoking  

## Project Challenges
- Getting the data visualization using plotly to work properly : we tried getting d3 to work and had a hard time time with it
- difficulties handling and processing the data in and out of the MongoDB
- Alot of time spent in the UI design (page layout, text, fonts, colors, etc) 
- 
## Background Research Questions
- what is a carbon footprint ? 
- How is carbon output calculated ? 
- What are a good sample of questions to represent a well-rounded carbon footprint? 
- What is plotly and how do you implement it? 
- what makes a good UI ? 

## Responsabilities 
- Georgina Cromwell : data display/homepage stuff, signup stuff   
- Corrin Courville : weekly update stuff,  signup stuff
- Kaitlin McDermott : all of the css and visual formatting
