Website: https://final-project-gcc-cmc-kmd.glitch.me/

## General description

Our website incorperates the following: 

- user login using passport 
- css using bootstrap : 
- css built from scratch
- data visualization using d3.js 
- db using mongodb 
- server using express


Additionally, you should incorporate features that you independently research, design, and implement for your project.

## Project ideation

Excellent projects serve someone/some group; for this assignment you need to define your users and stakeholders. I encourage you to identify projects that will have impact, either artistically, politically, or in terms of productivity. Consider creating something useful for a cause or hobby you care about.

## Logistics

### Team size
Students are encouraged to work in teams of 2-5 students for the project. This will allow you to build a good project without expending an excessive amount of effort. While I would expect a team of four or five students to produce a project with more features, I expect a every team's work to exhibit all of the required facets described above.

### Deliverables

__Proposal:__ 
Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of the team members. 
The outline should have enough detail so that staff can determine if it meets the minimum expectations, or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline.
This file must be named proposal.md so we can find it.
Submit a PR to turn it in by Monday, September 30th, before class

There are no other scheduled checkpoints for your project. 
You must be done in time to present before the final project demo day (October 10th). 

#### Turning in Your Outline / Project

**NOTE: code is due before the project presentation day due to the end of term / grading schedule constraints**
Submit a second PR on the final project repo to turn in your app and code.

Deploy your app, in the form of a webpage, to Glitch/Heroku/Digital Ocean or some other service.
Folks on the same team do not need to post the same webpage, but must instead clearly state who is on the team in their proposal.
(Staff will use the proposal to build the grading sheet.)
